## Note

This project was built referencing this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSMZgXzC9AA) by youtuber [DevAsLife](https://www.craftz.dog/). This version of my portfolio is intended as a learning experience to become acquainted with Next.js and other front-end technologies that have piqued my interest.
